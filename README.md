# Nuxt Security â€” Socket.io reproduction

This is the repository for the reproduction of the issue with the Nuxt Security module and Socket.io.

When `xssValidator` option is enabled, POST requests sent to socket.io are hanging.

When `xssValidator` option is enabled, with only `GET` requests as an allowed method, it also works.

When `xssValidator` option is disabled, everything works as expected.
